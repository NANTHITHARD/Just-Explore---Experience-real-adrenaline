      Outddor cooking differs substansiallu from kitchen-based cooking,the
      <br />
      obvious difference being lack of an easily defined kitchen area. As a
      <br />
      result, campers and backpackers have developed a significant body of

      <br />
      outdoor area. In UK English, a campsite is an area, usually divided into a
      <br />
      number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents, campervans
      <br />
      or caravans; this UK English use of the word is synonymous with the US
      <br />
      English expression campground.
